# Inactive Servers

If a server has closed down or has not been joinable for at least 3 months, we will add it to the `inactive.json`. This just flags our internal systems to not include the server in various place, but still retains all of the branding and other metadata you submit.

If you believe your server has been incorrectly marked as inactive, please open a pull request removing the servers ID from the [inactive.json](https://github.com/LunarClient/ServerMappings/blob/master/inactive.json) file.
