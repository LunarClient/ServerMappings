Servers may also provide a server banner. If it is required for your server, please take note of the following guidelines:

-   If a static banner is provided, it should be uploaded as a `.png` version named `banner.png`.
-   If an animated banner is provided, it should be uploaded as a `.gif` version named `banner.gif`.
-   The banner should represent the content of the server and prominently feature the server's name and/or IP.
-   All banners must have a minimum width of `351` pixels and a height of `45` pixels, resulting in a `35:5` aspect ratio.
-   Animated (GIF) banners must not exceed a total duration of 15 seconds.

Please ensure that your server banner meets these requirements. As with other assets, the server banner will be reviewed before being accepted.
