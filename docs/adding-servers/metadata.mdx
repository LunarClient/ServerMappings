# Server Metadata

Each server must have a `metadata.json`, this file should follow the schema found in the root of this repository `metadata.schema.json`.

An example can also be found in the root, `metadata.example.json`. This contains all the fields that are required for your server's metadata file.

## Required Fields

> These fields are required for your server to be accepted.

### Basic

Below is a table of the basic fields that are required for your server's metadata file, and a brief description of what they are.

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`          | This is the ID for the server, discussed in the [overview](server-mappings/adding-servers/overview), this must match the name of your server's folder. |
| `name`        | This is the name for your server.                                                                                                                      |
| `description` | This is the description for your server. It must be **between 16-80 characters**.                                                                      |

### Addresses

The `addresses` array in each server object is actually an array of IP suffixes. **This should not include the subdomain for the server**.

| ✅ Correct    | ❌ Incorrect       |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| `example.com` | `play.example.com` |
| `hypixel.net` | `play.hypixel.net` |
| `lunar.gg`    | `eu.lunar.gg`      |

The `primaryAddress` in each server object is for users to connect to your server on and is required to be resolvable. This primary address will be used to ensure that the server remains online and active. **This can (and should) include the subdomain for the server**.

### Game Types

Game types help identify the style of games that your server will offer to player. The following are games you may include: `PvP`, `PvE`, `HCF`, `Factions`, `Minigames`, `Skyblock`, `Parkour`, `UHC`, `Hardcore`, `Survival`, `Open World`, `Prison`, `Creative`, `Roleplay`, and `Adventure`.

### Colors

Each server must have a `primaryColor` and `secondaryColor`. These colors should represent the brand of your server. These colors must be in hexadecimal format, and must be prefixed with a `#`.

## Optional Fields

> While these fields are not required, they are highly recommended. Enriched servers are more likely to be utilized when being displayed.

### Minecraft Versions

The `minecraftVersions` field must be an array of client versions allowed on your Minecraft server. _(ie. 1.18.1, 1.19.2)_; The `primaryMinecraftVersion` field must be a subversion of a major version included in the `minecraftVersions` array.
