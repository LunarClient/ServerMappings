Servers may provide a background image. Please note the following requirements for the background image:

- The background image should be in the `.png` format.
- The image should represent either the artistic style or the content of the server.
- The minimum dimensions for the background image are `1920px` in width and `1080px` in height, resulting in a 16:9 aspect ratio.
- The file name should be `background.png`.
- The background image should be free of marketing, text, and any logos that are not part of the server build.

Please ensure that your background image meets these requirements. Remember that your background image will be manually reviewed before being accepted.
