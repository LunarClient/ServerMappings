Servers may provide a wordmark image in addition to their logo. Please note the following requirements for the wordmark image:

-   Be in the `.png` format.
-   Be transparent.
-   The minimum dimensions for the background image are `854px` in width and `480px` in height, resulting in a 16:9 aspect ratio.
-   Not be upscaled from a smaller low quality image

_Your logo will be manually reviewed before being accepted. Please ensure it meets these requirements._
