<summary>How long does it take for my server to appear in Discord/Lunar RPC?</summary>

After your pull request has been reviewed and merged, it typically takes around 24-48 hours before your server will start to appear.
In certain cases, like updating your server logo, it can take several days before appearing due to Discord's cache. There is nothing we're able to do about the cache.

**Note:** Do not alert or contact us asking for an update if it has __not__ been over 5 consecutive days after your pull request has been merged.

<summary>What should I do if I own or manage a domain that's in the inactive file?</summary>

You can open a fork, removing it from the `inactive.json` file. After that, ensure your server information is update and contains all the required information.

If you do not update your server information, your pull request will be denied.
