# Server Mappings

## Summary

This is a public mapping of server IPs <-> a pretty display name. This data is used extensively around Lunar Client, most notably when displaying server names (or "Private Server", if unknown) on the friends list. Historically, this mapping was handled internally, and server owners did not have a good way to manage data for their server.

## How do I add/update/remove a server?

Please feel free to open a PR against `servers.json` in this repository, and we'll review it as soon as possible. Once merged, Lunar Client services will update over the next 20 minutes.

## IP Addresses

The `addresses` array in each server object is actually an array of IP _suffixes_. For example, `"addresses": ["lunar.gg", "other.domain"]` will match `lunar.gg`, `na.lunar.gg`, `play.other.domain`, and so on.

## Restrictions

We ask that this repository is only used to store mappings for *public* Minecraft servers. Some server IPs, such as private SMPs, tournament servers, etc. should not be listed in this repository, out of respect for privacy.

## Can I use this data for ___?

Go for it.
