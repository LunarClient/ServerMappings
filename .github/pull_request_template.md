### General:

* [ ] The pull request title is descriptive. *(ex. `Added Lunar Network`, not `Updated servers.json`)*
* [ ] The pull request does not contain any unrelated commits.  *(ex. commits from previous pull requests)*

### Mapping Additions or Updates:

* [ ] My formatting matches the pre-existing formatting.
* [ ] There are no syntax errors.
* [ ] There is no pre-existing mapping with my id.
* [ ] My field values match your requirements.
* You can view our patterns here: [servers.schema.json](https://github.com/LunarClient/ServerMappings/blob/master/servers.schema.json), or take a look below and complete the field checklist:
  - [ ] `id`: a lowercase string *(ex. `myserver`)*
  - [ ] `name`: a string *(ex. `MyServerPvP`)*
  - [ ] `addresses`: an array with lowercase strings *(ex. of address `my.server`)*
    - You do not need to specify sub-domains, Lunar Client services automatically detect them.
